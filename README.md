# Hello World with Affinidi Trust Network: Your Quick Start Guide

In this workshop, you'll build [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) using the Affinidi Trust Network (ATN) that feature passwordless authentication flows, verifiable credential issuance, and consent-driven data access powered by the Iota framework. You'll also implement open standards-based workflows for collecting, storing, and sharing data securely, creating privacy-centric digital identity solutions.

## What you will build?

The workshop is structured into three key modules

- **Module 1: Implementing Passwordless Authentication**: Learn to create secure and user-friendly authentication flows without relying on traditional passwords using [Affinidi Login](/Module-1/affinidi-login.md)

  - Estimated time to complete the module: **15 min**

- **Module 2: Verifiable Credential Issuance**: Dive into the Credentials Issuance feature to issue tamper-evident digital credentials, enabling trust in digital interactions through the flow of portable trusted data using [Affinidi Credential Issuance Service](/Module-2/credentials-issuance.MD)

  - Estimated time to complete the module: **20 min**

- **Module 3: Building Consent-Driven Data Access**: Implement workflows that ensure users have full control over their data, with emphasis on secure and transparent data sharing practices using [Affinidi Iota Framework](/Module-3/iota-framework.MD)
  - Estimated time to complete the module: **20 min**

By the end of these modules, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how to leverage the Affinidi Trust Network (ATN) to build robust, user-centric interoperable applications.

> [!NOTE]
> Each module is directly related to the previous one, so make sure to try them one after another
